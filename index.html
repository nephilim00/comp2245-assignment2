        <h2> A look at the Ryzen 9 7950X3D</h2>
        <p class="post-info">September 30, 2023 by Keithley Meade</p>

        <p>The Ryzen 9 7950X3D is the AMD’s newest big-name addition to the Ryzen family 
          of CPUs. We wanted to spotlight a recent build featuring all 16 of its cores in 
          the Raptor Signature Edition. Running 32 threads and utilizing AMD’s 3D cache technology,
           the processor is absolutely no slouch, which proved true during testing</p>
        <p>Some of its specs include: Kingston Fury RGB DDR5 RAM (32GB), 2TB Samsung 990 PRO 2 SSD, Custom AIO Watercooling, 360mm, GeForce RTX 4090
          I would recomend this processor to those who are running programs (or games!) that demand a lot of L3 cache, or stress single cores.
           It has plenty of firepower for multithreaded applications as well

        <h2>How important is RAM speed?</h2>

        <p>Often asked questions about RAM speed, what is recommended, and how important it is for certain applications
           like gaming. The answer is a little more complicated than simply higher number = better. 
           So what is it exactly and how important is RAM speed?</p>
        <p>To start, RAM speed is a bit of a misnomer, so let’s first clarify some terms. How fast your system RAM performs 
          is actually dependent on several factors which include the frequency, bandwidth, total number of channels, quantity,
           dual data rate (DDR), latency, and even the speed/gen of your processor. When discussing “RAM speed” most users are
            actually referring to the frequency of the RAM – the number of commands it can process per second – so for the sake 
            of this discussion, I’ll do the same. RAM frequency is measured in MHz and usually immediately follows the DDR version 
            in the RAM spec. For example, 8GB DDR4-2400 RAM is running at a frequency of 2400MHz. Frequencies of RAM typically range 
            from 800MHz in older DDR2 modules up to 6800MHz in DDR5.
            What’s important to remember here is that system RAM is not handling command processes like the CPU does, so while a higher 
            CPU frequency will almost always mean better PC performance, the same may not be the case for high frequency RAM. This is why 
            though higher frequency RAM is technically faster, that additional speed often does not translate into better actual real world 
            performance.</p>
